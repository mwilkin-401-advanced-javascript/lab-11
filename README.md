Project Guidelines

Getting Started

Youâ€™ve been provided a server code with the authentication middleware, models and routes scaffolded in.

There are some potential bugs and missing logic.
Work with a partner!

Requirements

Assignment: Auth Server

Create a UML diagram of the authentication system on a whiteboard

Identify and fix any bugs

NEW CODE: Protect the /book and /book/:id routes by requiring user authentication

Document and publish the code with JSDoc

Testing

POST to /signup to create a new user

POST to /signin to login as a user (use basic auth)

Need tests for auth middleware and the routes

Does the middleware function (send it a basic header)

Do the routes assert the requirements (signup/signin)

Are the book routes protected properly?

Ensure that you use supergoose instead of mongo/express

Notes

Signup with httpie:

echo '{"username":"name","password":"pass"}' | http post :3000/signup
Signin with httpie:

http post :3000/signin -a username:password
You may also use Postman or RESTy
